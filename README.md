# piglatin

In this assignment you will write a program to translate English sentences into "Pig Latin."

Pig Latin is a "secret" language used by children, often in the belief that their parents won't understand them. The rules are simple:

If a word begins with a vowel, add "hay" to the end. Example: "apple" → "applehay".
If a word begins with one or more consonants, move those consonants to the end, and add "ay". Example: "string" → "ingstray".
The innocent-sounding words "vowel" and "word" are not easy to define precisely. For the purposes of this assignment:
Letters are whatever the method isalpha says they are. (This includes the 26 uppercase and 26 lowercase letters in the English alphabet).
The vowels are a e i o u and their uppercase variants, but never y or w.
You can assume that every word contains at least one of the above vowels.
The words are non-empty strings that you find by applying the following rules:
Spaces go between words. Use spaces to break a "sentence" into word-like chunks.
Hint: sentence.split(' ') will give return a list of strings, but some of those strings will be the empty string, and those you need to get rid of.
Each word-like chunk will consist of a word followed by zero or more non-letters.
Example: The string "Hello," consists of the word (by our rules) Hello and the non-letter , (comma).
Hint: my_string.isalpha() will return True if my_string contains nothing but letters. (Note that my_string could be a single character.)
We will not handle:
Punctuation at the beginning of a word: "--Dave"
Groups of characters not containing a vowel: "$500", "  --  ", "cwm"
You may handle the above if you like, but we won't test for them.


def is_vowel(ch)
Return True if ch is a vowel, False if it isn't.
def cut(word)
Given a word (as defined above), return a 2-tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string of consonants at the beginning of the word (could be the empty string), and the second element is a string of all the remaining characters. For example, cut("String") should return the tuple ("Str", "ing").
def piggify_word(word)
Returns the Pig Latin version of a single word. (Hint: Use the cut function.)
def clean_word(raw_word)
"Cleans" the given "raw" word by removing any non-letter characters from the end, and returning a 2-tuple of the cleaned word and the removed characters. For example, clean_word("Wow!") should return ("Wow", "!").
def get_raw_words(sentence)
Uses the space character (' ') to separate the sentence into a list of word-like chunks ("raw" words), and returns that list of chunks. For example, get_raw_words("Madam, I'm Adam.") should return the list ["Madam,", "I'm", "Adam."].
def piggify_pairs(pair_list)
Takes a list of (word, punctuation) pairs and returns the corresponding list of ("piggified" word, punctuation) pairs. For example, piggify_pairs([("hi", ""), ("there", "!")]) should return [("ihay", ""), ("erethay", "!")].
def reassemble(pair_list)
Reassembles a list of (word, punctuation) pairs into a sentence. The word and its associated punctuation are concatenated, and the words are assembled into a sentence, with spaces between words (but no space at the beginning or at the end). For example, reassemble([("ihay", ""), ("erethay", "!")]) should return "ihay erethay!".
def piggify_sentence(sentence)
Takes a sentence, turns each word in the sentence into the corresponding Pig Latin version, then returns the altered sentence. Punctuation is preserved.
